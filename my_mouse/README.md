## Task
My Mouse - find shorest path from map

## Description
##### A program that finds the shortest path from a given map
We used basic OOP principles in the project.
#### Definition of a valid map :
* All lines must respect the sizes given in the first line (LINExCOL).
* There can only be one entrance.
* There must be only one exit.
* There must be a solution to the labyrinth.
* The labyrinth will not be more than a thousand square.
* At the end of each line, there is a new line.
* The characters present in the map must be only those shown on the first
line.
* If there is an invalid map, you will print MAP ERROR on STDERR followed by a new line. The program will then proceed to the next labyrinth
treatment.
